‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**:  WalletGen is a research and educational tool and must not be used for unauthorized access or malicious activities. Please use this tool responsibly and only on wallets that you own or have explicit permission to access.

## How It Works

WalletGen uses [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) for Bitcoin, and the [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) hashing algorithm for EVM-based blockchains like Ethereum.

The core function is to compare generated addresses against a database or check them in real-time with blockchain explorers. WalletGen, built with C++, offers significantly higher speeds compared to similar tools. The performance is primarily determined by the capabilities of your CPU and GPU.

## Why Choose WalletGen for Seed Phrase Searching?

Why use a slow search? **WalletGen** is built for speed! Written in C++ and optimized for CPU and GPU, it delivers up to **10x faster** performance. If you are trying to find a lost seed phrase, explore existing wallets, or reclaim your crypto, WalletGen offers the best approach.

## Features

-   **Cryptocurrency Wallet Generation**: Generate wallets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, and others.
-   **Brute-Force Seed Searching**: Use brute-force techniques to search for existing wallets.
-   **Algorithm Support**: Keccak256 for EVM and BIP39, BIP44, and Bech32 for Bitcoin.

## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** allows you to check wallet balances by using brute-force methods.

### Bitcoin (BTC) Wallet Search:

*   Press key `3` or run `start_search_btc.bat` to search Bitcoin wallets using the internet. This can be slower due to real-time checks.
*   Press key `6` for a faster method - searching using the database.

### EVM Wallet Search (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Press key `5` or run `start_search_evm.bat` to search online.
*   Press key `6` to use the database for speed.

### Speed Considerations:

*   Your hardware, especially the GPU, heavily impacts speed.

Databases greatly improve search efficiency.

## The Program Found a Wallet ‚Äî What‚Äôs Next?

If WalletGen finds a wallet with a balance:
*   The search will **Stop** immediately.
*   The wallet details are **Displayed** in the console.
*   Data is **Saved** in the `found_wallets.txt` file.

### How to Access the Funds?

1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** into any compatible crypto wallet (Metamask, Trust Wallet, Electrum, etc.).
2.  You can transfer the funds to a wallet you control.

## Recovery Your Bitcoin Wallet

WalletGen can recover Bitcoin wallets using the seed phrase, whether complete or incomplete.

### Process Description

#### Search for Missing Words:

Use * for missing words. WalletGen checks combinations.

#### Entering a Complete Seed Phrase:

Enter the full 12-word seed. WalletGen generates and checks addresses.

### Important Recommendations

*   Seed phrases must be 12 words.
*   Use * only for missing words.
*   Searching for missing words takes time.
*   Upon recovery, data is saved.
